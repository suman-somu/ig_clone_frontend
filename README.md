# instgram_clone

I tried to make a clone of Instagramm. The functionality includes signing an account, posting, feed and follow accounts.

The backend is written in javascript using express framework. Backend repo link - [link](https://github.com/suman-somu/instgram-clone-backend)

I have used monogoDB as the database and Appwrite storage for storing media.
